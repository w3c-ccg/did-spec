<p>
This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
Decentralized Identifier space by using specialized terms to discuss specific
concepts. This terminology is included below and linked to throughout the
document to aid the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Blockchain</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A specific type of <a>distributed ledger</a> technology (DLT) that
stores ledger entries in blocks of transactions that are grouped
together and hashed into a cryptographic chain. Because this type of DLT
was introduced by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>,
the term "blockchain" is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Bitcoin
ledger.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID|DIDs|decentralized identifiers">Decentralized Identifier</dfn> (DID)</dt>

  <dd>
A globally unique identifier that does
not require a centralized registration authority because it is
registered with <a>distributed ledger</a> technology or other form of
decentralized network. The generic format of a DID is defined in this
specification. A specific <a>DID scheme</a> is defined in a
<a>DID method</a> specification.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Decentralized Identity Management</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">Identity
Management</a> based on <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
Decentralized Identity Management extends the identifier creation authority
beyond the traditional roots of trust
required by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500
directory services</a>, the <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name
System</a>, and most national ID systems.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</dfn> (DPKI)</dt>

  <dd>
Public key infrastructure based on
decentralized identifiers and identity records (e.g., DID Documents) containing
verifiable public key descriptions.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Dependent</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A person, organization, or thing whose <a>DID</a> is
registered and maintained by a delegate because the dependent is not in
a position to control the private keys. A dependent becomes an
<a>identity owner</a> when the dependent takes control of the private keys.
  </dd>


  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Document</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A set of data that describes a
<a>DID</a>, including mechanisms, such as public keys and
pseudonymous biometrics, that an entity can use to authenticate itself as the
DID. A DID Document may also contain other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a>
describing the entity. These documents are graph-based data structures that
are typically expressed using [[!JSON-LD]], but may be expressed using other
compatible graph-based data formats.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Fragment</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The portion of a <a>DID reference</a> that follows the first hash
sign character ("#"). A DID fragment uses the same syntax as a URI
fragment. See section 5.5. Note that a DID fragment MUST immediately
follow a DID. If a DID reference includes a DID path followed by a
fragment, that fragment is NOT a DID fragment.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Method</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A definition of how a specific DID scheme can be implemented
on a specific distributed ledger or network, including the precise
method(s) by which DIDs and DID Documents can be read, written, and revoked.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Path</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The portion of a <a>DID reference</a> that follows the first forward
slash character. A DID path uses the identical syntax as a URI path. See
section 5.4. Note that if a DID path is followed by a fragment, that
fragment is NOT a <a>DID fragment</a>.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Reference</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A DID plus an optional <a>DID path</a> or <a>DID fragment</a>.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID Scheme</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The formal syntax of a <a>Decentralized Identifier</a>. The generic DID
scheme is defined in this specification. A
<a>DID method</a> specification
defines a specific <a>DID scheme</a> that works with a specific DID method.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="DLT">Distributed Ledger</dfn> (aka DLT, <a>blockchain</a>)</dt>

  <dd>
A <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database">distributed
database</a> in which the various nodes use a <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus
protocol</a> to maintain a shared ledger in which each transaction is
cryptographically signed and chained to the previous transaction
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Delegate</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
An entity who creates a DID for a <a>dependent</a> who
does not yet have the capacity to control the private keys. The
dependent must rely on the delegate to safeguard the private keys until
the dependent can assume control and become an entity.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Identity Owner</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The natural person, party, organization, or thing whose
identity is represented by a <a>DID</a> and who directly controls the
private keys to control the <a>DID Document</a>.
(Note: this specification avoids the term "user" since an entity is not
always an individual person.)
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">Key Description</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A JSON object contained inside a DID Document that contains all
the metadata necessary to use a public key or verification key. A list
of standard key descriptions is included in
Appendix <a href="#standard-key-descriptions"></a>.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="service endpoints">Service Endpoint</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A network address at which a service operates on
behalf of an entity. Examples of specific services include
discovery services, social networks, file storage services, and
verifiable claim repository services. Service endpoints may also be provided
by a generalized data interchange protocol such as
<a>Extensible Data Interchange</a>.
  </dd>



  <dt><dfn data-lt="">UUID</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
Universally Unique Identifier as specified by <a href=
  "https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122</a> .
  </dd>


  <dt><dfn data-lt="XDI">Extensible Data Interchange</dfn> (aka XDI)</dt>

  <dd>
A semantic
graph format and semantic data interchange protocol defined by the
  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi/">OASIS XDI Technical
Committee</a>.
  </dd>
